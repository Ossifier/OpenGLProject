Current To-Dos:

1. Work out funny business with the Camera Object, fix the angle up/down look so that the calculation for the view projection is equal.
2. Build different kinds of Cameras that you can select. Flyby, traditional FPS, other kinds as they come to mind?
3. Figure out how to utilize mutilple Shader Objects in a single scene. How to do?.
4. Create a branch for object-less window context, so I can pull down a version of the project without any objects for development.
5. Work out the Decaying Animation functions. These are intended to be used to when triggered. Will need to think about how to do this in code.
